AUTOMATICALLY ORGANISE YOUR ANY Windows OS FOLDER ACCORDING TO FILE EXTENSIONS

Run the script and give it the path to organise/organize i.e.
C:\Users\User\Downloads\

It checks all extensions in the directory and creates folders of it and moves all the extension files in its respective folders. The non-extension files go to the unknown folder. 

The files which already have the same name file present in the to-copy 
folder the file is moved but with an increment on the filename i.e. 
hello.txt is copied as hello(1).txt to the new folder.

The copied file increments work for maximum till 2 digits which is 99. 
For more numbers it has to be added in the increment function.
